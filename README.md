# Link All the Languages!

An ongoing project created by Alexander Hill where we link as many programming languages as possible into a single executable.

## Theory

Most programming languages provide a foreign function interface to the C language. Therefore, language X should be able to call functions in language Y and language Y should be able to call functions in language X using the C ABI.

## Languages

### Tier 3 (Statically linked and fully interoperable)

- Assembly
- C

### Tier 2 (Can call C and be called by C)

- C++
- D

## Rules for including languages

1. Languages must be statically linked
2. Languages must be able to use their standard library
3. Languages must be able to call C and be called by C
4. Languages must be stable(1.0.0 or greater in semantic versioning)
